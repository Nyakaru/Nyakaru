### Hi there 👋

I am a self-taught Full-Stack Engineer.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on *open-source* projects that help vulnerable people in society or improve the well-being of people.
- 💬 Ask me about *GraphQL, Javascript, Typescript and Python* 😊  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can play over 5 game balls comfortably. Sounds cool!! Right?
